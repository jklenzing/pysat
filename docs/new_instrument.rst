Adding a New Instrument
=======================

.. role:: python(code)
   :language: python

pysat works by calling modules written for specific instruments
that load and process the data consistent with the pysat standard. The name
of the module corresponds to the combination 'platform_name' provided when
initializing a pysat instrument object. The module should be placed in the
pysat instruments directory or registered (see below) for automatic discovery. Some data repositories 
have pysat templates prepared to assist in integrating a new instrument. See :ref:`supported-data-templates` for more.

A compatible module may be supplied directly to :python:`pysat.Instrument(inst_module = myInstrument)`
if it also contains attributes platform and name. Such modules may be registered as 
part of pysat's user instrument registry using the following syntax:

.. code-block:: python

  from pysat.utils import registry
  registry.register('my.package.myInstrument')

After registry, the instrument module name is stored in the user's home directory
under :code:`~.pysat/user_modules.txt`. The instrument may then be instantiated with 
the instrument's platform and name:

.. code-block:: python

  inst = Instrument('myplatform', 'myname')


Naming Conventions
------------------

pysat uses a hierarchy of named variables to define each specific data product.
In order, this is

* platform
* name
* sat_id
* tag

The exact usage of these can be tailored to the nature of the mission and data
products.  In general, each combination should point to a unique data file.
Not every data product will need all of these variable names.  Both `sat_id`
and `tag` can be instantiated as an empty string if unused, or if a default
is preferred. Examples are given below.

**platform**

In general, this is the name of the mission or observatory.  Examples include
ICON, JRO, COSMIC, and SuperDARN.  Note that this may be a single satellite or
ground-based observatory, a constellation of satellites, or a collaboration of
ground-based observatories.

**name**

In general, this is the name of the instrument or high-level data product.
When combined with the platform, this forms a unique file in the `instruments`
directory.  Examples include the EUV instrument on ICON (icon_euv) and the
Incoherent Scatter Radar at JRO (jro_isr).

**sat_id**

In general, this is a unique identifier for a satellite in a constellation of
identical or similar satellites, or multiple instruments on the same satellite
with different look directions.  For example, the DMSP satellites carry similar
instrument suites across multiple spacecraft.  These are labeled as F11-F18.

**tag**

In general, the tag points to a specific data product.  This could be a
specific processing level (such as L1, L2), or a product file (such as the
different profile products for cosmic_gps data).

Each instrument file will include the platform and name as variables at the
top-level of the file.  Potential tags and sat_ids will be stored as
dictionaries.  The DMSP IVM (dmsp_ivm) is a good example of a pysat instrument
that uses all levels of variable names.

.. code:: python

  platform = 'your_platform_name'
  name = 'name_of_instrument'
  tags = {'': 'The standard processing for the data.  Loaded by default',
          'fancy': 'A higher-level processing of the data.'}
  sat_ids = {'A': ['', 'fancy'], 'B': ['', 'fancy'], 'C': []}

Note that the possible tags that can be invoked are '' and 'fancy'.  The tags
dictionary includes a long name for each of these tags.  A blank tag will be
loaded by default if the user does not specify a tag.

The sat_ids are also stored in a dictionary.  Each key name here points to a
list of the possible tags that can be associated with that particular satellite.
Note that not all satellites support every level of processing.  In this case,
the 'fancy' processing is available for satellites A and B, but not C.

For a dataset that does not need multiple levels of tags and sat_ids, an empty
string can be used to let pysat know how many levels the dataset has.

.. code:: python

  platform = 'your_platform_name'
  name = 'name_of_instrument'
  tags = {'': ''}
  sat_ids = {'': ['']}


Required Routines
-----------------

Three functions are required by pysat for operation, with supporting
information for testing:

**list_files**

Pysat maintains a list of files to enable data management functionality. It needs a pandas Series of filenames indexed by time. Pysat expects the module method platform_name.list_files to be:

.. code:: python

   def list_files(tag=None, data_path=None):
       return pandas.Series(files, index=datetime_index)

where tag indicates a specific subset of the available data from cnofs_vefi.

See pysat.utils.time.create_datetime_index for creating a datetime index for an array of irregularly sampled times.

Pysat will store data in pysat_data_dir/platform/name/tag, helpfully provided in data_path, where pysat_data_dir is specified by using `pysat.utils.set_data_dir(pysat_data_dir)`.

`pysat.Files.from_os` is a convenience constructor provided for filenames that include time information in the filename and utilize a constant field width. The location and format of the time information is specified using standard python formatting and keywords year, month, day, hour, minute, second. A complete list_files routine could be as simple as

.. code:: python

   def list_files(tag=None, data_path=None):
       return pysat.Files.from_os(data_path=data_path,
                    format_str='cindi-{year:4d}{day:03d}-ivm.hdf')

The list_files function can be invoked from within ipython by calling

.. code:: python

  instrument.files.files

where instrument is the name of the instrument object.  Likewise, files can be directly listed when instantiating an instrument object by adding `update_files=True`.

.. code:: python
    inst = pysat.Instrument(platform=platform, name=name, update_files=True)


**load**

Loading is a fundamental pysat activity, this routine enables the user to consider loading a hidden implementation 'detail'.

.. code:: python

   def load(fnames, tag=None):
       return data, meta

- The load routine should return a tuple with (data, pysat metadata object).
- `data` is a pandas DataFrame, column names are the data labels, rows are
  indexed by datetime objects.  For multi-dimensional data, an xarray can be
  used.
- `pysat.utils.create_datetime_index` provides for quick generation of an
  appropriate datetime index for irregularly sampled data set with gaps
- pysat meta object obtained from `pysat.Meta()`. Use pandas DataFrame indexed
  by name with columns for 'units' and 'long_name'. Additional arbitrary
  columns allowed. See `pysat.Meta` for more information on creating the
  initial metadata.
- If metadata is already stored with the file, creating the Meta object is
  trivial. If this isn't the case, it can be tedious to fill out all
  information if there are many data parameters. In this case it is easier to
  fill out a text file. A convenience function is provided for this
  situation. See `pysat.Meta.from_csv` for more information.



**download**

Download support significantly lowers the hassle in dealing with any dataset.
Fetch data from the internet.

.. code:: python

   def download(date_array, data_path=None, user=None, password=None):
       return

* date_array, a list of dates to download data for
* data_path, the full path to the directory to store data
* user, string for username
* password, string for password

Routine should download data and write it to disk.


Optional Routines
-----------------

**initialize**


Initialize any specific instrument info. Runs once.

.. code:: python

   def init(inst):
       return None

inst is a pysat.Instrument() instance. init should modify inst in-place as needed; equivalent to a 'modify' custom routine.

**default**


First custom function applied, once per instrument load.

.. code:: python

   def default(inst):
       return None

inst is a pysat.Instrument() instance. default should modify inst in-place as needed; equivalent to a 'modify' custom routine.

**clean**


Cleans instrument for levels supplied in inst.clean_level.
  * 'clean' : expectation of good data
  * 'dusty' : probably good data, use with caution
  * 'dirty' : minimal cleaning, only blatant instrument errors removed
  * 'none'  : no cleaning, routine not called

.. code:: python

   def clean(inst):
       return None

inst is a pysat.Instrument() instance. clean should modify inst in-place as needed; equivalent to a 'modify' custom routine.

**list_remote_files**

Returns a list of available files on the remote server.

.. code:: python

    def list_remote_files(inst):
        return list_like

This method is called by several internal `pysat` functions, and can be directly called by the user through the `inst.remote_file_list` command.  The user can search for subsets of files through optional keywords, such as

.. code:: python

    inst.remote_file_list(year=2019)
    inst.remote_file_list(year=2019, month=1, day=1)


Testing Support
---------------
All modules defined in the __init__.py for pysat/instruments are automatically
tested when pysat code is tested. To support testing all of the required
routines, additional information is required by pysat.

Example code from dmsp_ivm.py. The attributes are set at the top level simply
by defining variable names with the proper info. The various satellites within
DMSP, F11, F12, F13 are separated out using the sat_id parameter. 'utd' is used
as a tag to delineate that the data contains the UTD developed quality flags.

.. code:: python

   platform = 'dmsp'
   name = 'ivm'
   tags = {'utd': 'UTDallas DMSP data processing',
           '': 'Level 1 data processing'}
   sat_ids = {'f11': ['utd', ''], 'f12': ['utd', ''], 'f13': ['utd', ''],
              'f14': ['utd', ''], 'f15': ['utd', ''], 'f16': [''], 'f17': [''],
              'f18': ['']}
   _test_dates = {'f11': {'utd': pysat.datetime(1998, 1, 2)},
                  'f12': {'utd': pysat.datetime(1998, 1, 2)},
                  'f13': {'utd': pysat.datetime(1998, 1, 2)},
                  'f14': {'utd': pysat.datetime(1998, 1, 2)},
                  'f15': {'utd': pysat.datetime(2017, 12, 30)}}

    # support load routine
    def load(fnames, tag=None, sat_id=None):
        # code normally follows, example terminates here

The rationale behind the variable names is explained above under Naming
Conventions.  What is important here are the _test_dates.  Each of these points
to a specific date for which the unit tests will attempt to download and load
data as part of end-to-end testing.  Make sure that the data exists for the
given date. The tags without test dates will not be tested. The leading underscore
in _test_dates ensures that this information is not added to the instrument's meta
attributes, so it will not be present in IO operations.

Data Acknowledgements
=====================

Acknowledging the source of data is key for scientific collaboration.  This can
generally be put in the `init` function of each instrument.  Relevant
citations should be included in the instrument docstring.


.. _supported-data-templates:

Supported Data Templates
========================


NASA CDAWeb
-----------

A template for NASA CDAWeb pysat support is provided. Several of the routines within are intended to be used with functools.partial in the new instrument support code. When writing custom routines with a new instrument file download support would be added via

.. code:: python

   def download(.....)

Using the CDAWeb template the equivalent action is

.. code:: python

   download = functools.partial(methods.nasa_cdaweb.download,
                                supported_tags)

where supported_tags is defined as dictated by the download function. See the routines for cnofs_vefi and cnofs_ivm for practical uses of the NASA CDAWeb support code.

Madrigal
-----------

A template for Madrigal pysat support is provided. Several of the routines within are intended to be used with functools.partial in the new instrument support code. When writing custom routines with a new instrument file download support would be added via

.. code:: python

    def download(.....)

Using the Madrigal template the equivalent action is

.. code:: python

     def download(date_array, tag='', sat_id='', data_path=None, user=None,
                  password=None):
         methods.madrigal.download(date_array, inst_code=str(madrigal_inst_code),
                                   kindat=str(madrigal_tag[sat_id][tag]),
                                   data_path=data_path, user=user,
                                   password=password)

See the routines for `dmsp_ivm` and `jro_isr` for practical uses of the Madrigal support code.

Additionally, use of the methods.madrigal class should acknowledge the CEDAR rules of the road.  This can be done by Adding

.. code:: python

     def init(self):

         print(methods.madrigal.cedar_rules())
         return

to each routine that uses Madrigal data access.
